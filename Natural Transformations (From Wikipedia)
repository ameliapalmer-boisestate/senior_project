\maketitle


    In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a natural transformation provides a way of transforming one functor
into another while respecting the internal structure (i.e., the composition of morphisms) of the categories involved. 
Hence, a natural transformation can be considered to be a "morphism of functors". Informally, the notion of a
natural transformation states that a particular map between functors can be done consistently over an entire category.


    Indeed, this intuition can be formalized to define so-called functor categories. Natural transformations are,
after categories and functors, one of the most fundamental notions of category theory and consequently appear in the 
majority of its applications.


\section{Definition}


    If $F$ and $G$ are functors between the categories $C$ and $D$, then a natural transformation $\eta$ from $F$ to 
$G$ is a family of morphisms that satisfies two requirements.


\begin{enumerate}

    \item The natural transformation must associate, to every object $X$ in $C$, a morphism $\eta_X : F(X) \to G(X)$
    between objects of $D$. The morphism $\etq_X$ is called the component of $\eta$ at $X$.

    \item Components must be such that for every morphism 
        $f : X \to Y$ in $C$ we have:
            $\eta_Y \circ F(f) = G(f) \circ \eta_X\eta$
\end{enumerate}


The last equation can conveniently be expressed as by the commutative diagram.


% This diagram has one to-arrow on the side, to the side and a square of to-arrows

%The to-arrow on the side is the following

$X \to^f Y$  

%The top of the square has the following

$F(X) \to^{\eta_X} G(X)$

%The bottom of the square has the following 

$F(Y) \to^{\eta_Y} G(Y)$

%The left side of the square points from the top left corner to the bottom left corner with the following

$F(X) \to^{F(f)} F(Y)$

%The right side of the square points from the top right corner to the bottom right corner with the following

$G(X) \to^{G(f)} G(Y)$

    If both $F$ and $G$ are contravariant, the vertical arrows in the right diagram are reversed. If $\eta$ is a natural
transformation from $F$ to $G$, we also write $\eta : F \to G$ or $\eta : F \Rightarrow G$. This is also expressed
by saying the family of morphisms $\eta_X : F(X) \to G(X)$ is natural in $X$.


    If, for every object $X$ in $C$, the morphism $\eta_X$ is an isomorphism in $D$, then $\eta$ is said to be a natural
isomorphism (or sometimes natural equivalence or isomorphism of functors). Two functors $F$ and $G$ are called 
naturally isomorphic or simply isomorphic if there exists a natural isomorphism from $F$ to $G$.


    An infranatural transformation $\eta$ from $F$ to $G$ is simply a family of morphisms $\eta_X : F(X) \to G(X)$,
for all $X$ in $C$. Thus a natural transformation is an infranatural transformation for which $\eta_Y \circ F(f) = G(f) \circ \eta_X$
for every morphism $f: X \to Y$. The naturalizer of $\eta$, $nat(\eta)$, is the largest subcategory of $C$ containing
all the objects of $C$ on which $\eta$ restricts to a natural transformation.



\section{Examples}


\textbf{Opposite Group}


Statements such as


    "Every group is naturally isomorphic to its opposite group"


abound in modern mathematics. We will now give the precise meaning of this statement
as well as its proof. Consider the category $\mathbf{Grp}$ of all groups with group
homomorphisms as morphisms. If $(G,*)$, is a group, we define its opposite group
$(G^{op}, *^{op})$ as follows: $G^{op}$ is the same set as $G$, and the operation $*^{op}$ is defined by
$(G^{op},*^{op})$ as follows: $G^{op}$ is the same set as $G$, and the operation $*^{op}$ are thus "turned around". Forming the
opposite group becomes a (covariant) functor from $\mathbf{Grp}$ to $\mathbf{Grp}$ if we define $f^{op} = f$
for any group homomorphism $f: G \to H$. Note that $f^{op}$ is indeed a group
homomorphism from $G^{op}$ to $H^{op}$:


    $f^{op}(a*^{op}b) = f(b*a) = f(b) * f(a) = f^{op} (a) *^{op} f^{op}(b)$.


    The content of the above statement is:


    "The identity functor $Id_{\mathbf{Grp}} : \mathbf{Grp} \to \mathbf{Grp}$ is naturally isomprhic to the opposite
    functor $\mathbf{op} : \mathbf{Grp} \to \mathbf{Grp}$"

To prove this, we need to provide isomorphisms $\eta_G : G \to G^{op}$ for every group $G$, such
that the above diagram commutes. Set $\eta_G (a) = a^{-1}$. The formulas
$(a * b)^{-1} = b^{-1} * a^{-1} = a^{-1} *^{op} b^{-1}$ and $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ show that $\eta_G$ is a grou
homomorphism with inverse $\eta_{G_{op}}$. To prove the naturality, we start with a group
for all $a$ in $G$. This is true since $f^{op} = f$ and every group homomorphism has the
property $(f(a))^{-1}=f(a^-1)$


\textbf{Abelianization}


    Given a group $G$, we can define its abelianization $G^{ab} = G / [G,G]$. Let $\pi_G : G \to G^{ab}$
denote the projection map onto the cosets of $[G,G]$. This homomorphism is "natural in
$G$", i.e., it defines a natural transformation, which we now check. Let $H$ be a group. For
any homomorphism $f: G \to H$, we have that $[G,G]$ is contained in the kernel of
$\pi_H \circ f$, because any homomorphism into an abelian group kills the commutator
subgroup. Then $\pi_H \circ f$ factors through $G^{ab}$ as $f^{ab} \circ \pi_G = \pi_H \circ f$ for the unique
homomorphism $f^{ab} : G^{ab} \to H^{ab}$. This makes $\mathbf{ab : Grp \to Grp}$  a functor and $\pi$ a
natural transformation, but not a natural isomorphism, from the identity functor to $\mathbf{ab}$.


\textbf{Hurewicz homomorphism}


Functors and natural transformations abound in algebraic topology, with the Hurewicz
homomorphisms serving as examples. For any pointed topological space $\textbf{(X,x)}$ and
positive integer $n$ there exists a group homomorphism


    $h_n : \pi_n (X,x) \to H_n (X)$


from the $n$-th homotopy group of $(X,x)$ to the $n$-th homology group of $X$. Both $\pi_n$
and $H_n$ are functors from the category \textbf{Top^*} of a pointed topological spaces to the 
category $\textbf{Grp}$ of groups, and $h_n$ is a natural transformation from $\pi_n$ to $H_n$. 


\textbf{Determinant}


    Given commutative rings $R$ and $S$ with a ring homomorphism $f : R \to S$, the respective
groups of invertible $n \times n$ matrices $GL_n (R)$ and $GL_n (S)$ inherit a homomorphism
which we denote by $GL_n (f)$, obtained by applying $f$ to each matrix entry. Similarly, $f$
restricts to a group homomorphism $f^* : R^* \to S^*$, where $R^*$ denotes the group of
units of $R$. In fact, $GL_n$ and $*$ are functors from the category of commutative rings
$\textbf{CRing}$ to $\textbf{Grp}$. The determinant on the group $GL_n (R)$, denoted by $\text{det}_R$, is a group
homomorphism


    $\text{det}_R : GL_n (R) \to R^*$


which is natural in $R:$ because the determinant is defined by the same formula for every
ring, $f \circ \text{det}_R = \text{det}_S \circ GL_n (f)$ holds. This makes the determinant a natural
transformation from $GL_n$ to $*$.


\textbf{Double dual of a vector space}


If $K$ is a field, then for every vector space $V$ over $K$ we have a "natural" injective linear
map $V \to V^{**}$ from the vector space into its double dual. These maps are "natural" in
the following sense: the double dual operation is a functor, and the maps are the
components of a natural transformation from the identity functor to the double dual
functor.


\textbf{Finite calculus}


For every abelian group $G$, the set $\text{Hom}_{\text{Set}} (\mathbb{Z}, U(G))$ of functions from the integers to
the underlying set of $G$ forms an abelian group $V_{\mathbb{Z}(G)}$ under pointwise addition. (here
$U$ is the standard forgetful functor $U : \mathbf{Ab \to Set}$.) Given an $\mathbf{Ab}$ morphism
$\varphi : G \to G'$, the map $V_\mathbb{Z} (\varphi) : V_\mathbb{Z} (G) \to V_\mathbb{Z} (G')$ given by left compromising $\varphi$ with the
elements of the former is itself a homomorphism of abelian groups; in this way we obtain
a functor $V_\mathbb{Z} : \mathbf{Ab \to Ab}$ The finite difference operate $\Delta_G$ taking each function
$f : \mathbb{Z} \to U(G)$ to $\Delta(f) : n \mapsto f(n + 1) - f(n)$ is a map from $V_\mathbb{Z} (G)$ to itself, and the
collection $\Delta$ of such maps gives a natural transformation $\Delta : V_\mathbb{Z} \to Z_\mathbb{Z}$.


\textbf{Tensor-hom adjunction}


Consider the category $mathbf{Ab}$ of abelian groups and group homomorphisms. For all abelian
groups, $X, Y$ and $Z$ we have a group isomorphism

    $\text{Hom}(X \otimes Y, Z) \to  \text{Hom}(X, \text{Hom}(Y,Z))$\dots


These isomorphisms are "natural" in the sense that they define a natural transformation
between the two involved functor $\mathbf{Ab^{op} \times Ab^{op} \times Ab \to Ab}$. (Here "op" is the
opposite category of $\mathbf{Ab}$, not to be confused with the trivial opposite group functor on $\mathbf{AB}$!)


This is formally the tensor-hom adjunction, and is an archetypal example of a pair of
adjoint functors. Natural transformations arise frequently in conjunction with adjoint 
functors, and indeed, adjoint functors are defined by a certain natural isomorphism.
Additionally, every pair of adjoint functors comes equipped with two natural
transformations (generally not isomorphisms) called the unit and counit.


\section{Unnatural isomorphism}


The notion of a natural transformation is categorical, and states (informally) that a
particular map between functors can be done consistently over an entire category.
Informally, a particular map (esp. an isomorphism) between individual objects (not entire
categories) is referred to as a "natural isomorphism", meaning implicitly that it is actually
defined on the entire category, and defines a natural transformation of functors;
formalizing this intuition was a motivating factor in the development of category theory.
Conversely, a particular map between particular objects may be called an unnatural
isomorphism (or "this isomorphism is not natural") if the map cannot be extended to a
natural transformation on the entire category. Given an object $X$, a functor $G$ (taking for
simplicity the first functor to be the indentity) and an isomorphism $\eta: X \to G(X)$, proof
of unnaturality is most easily shown by giving an automorphism $A : X \to Y$ that does
not commute with this isomorphism (so $\eta \circ A \neq G(A) \circ \eta$). More strongly, if one wishes
to prove that $X$ and $G(X)$ are not naturally isomorphic, without reference to a particular
isomorphism, this requires showing that for any isomorphism $\eta$, there is some $A$ with
which it does not commute; in some cases a single automorphism $A$ works for all
candidate isomorphisms $\eta$ while in other cases one must show how to construct a
different $A_n$ for each isomorphism. The maps of the category play a crucial role - any
infranatural transform is natural if the only maps are the identity map, for instance.


This is similar (but more categorical) to concepts in group theory or module theory,
where a given decomposition of an object into a direct sum is "not natural", or rather
"not unique", as automorphisms exist that do not preserve the direct sum decomposition
- see Structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain
$\S$ Uniqueness for example.



Some authors distinguish notationally, using $\cong$ for a natural isomorphism and $\approx$ for an
unnatural isomorphism, reserving $=$ for equality (usually equality of maps).


\textbf{Example: fundamental group of torus}


As an example of the distinction between the functorial statement and individual objects,
consider homotopy groups of a product space, specifically the fundamental group of the
torus.



The homotopy groups of a product space are naturally the product of the homotopy
groups of the components, $\pi_n ((X, x_0) \times (Y, y_0)) \cong \pi_n ((X, x_0)) \times \pi_n ((Y, y_0))$,
with the isomorphism given by projection onto the two factors, fundamentally because
maps into a product space are exactly products of maps into the components - this is a
functorial statement.

However, the torus (which is abstractly a product of two circles) has fundamental group
isomorphic to $Z^2$, but the splitting $\pi_1 (T,t_0) \approx \mathbf{Z} \times \mathbf{Z}$ is not natural. Note the use of $\approx$,
$\cong$, and $=$:


    $\pi_1 (T,t_0) \approx \pi_1 (S^1, x_0) \times \pi_1 (S^1 , y_0) \cong \mathbf{Z} \times \mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{Z}^2$. 


This abstract isomorphism with a product is not natural, as some isomorphisms of $T$ do
not preserve the product: the self-homeomorphism of $T$ (thought of as the quotient
space $R^2 / \mathbb{Z}^2$) given by

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}


(geometrically a Dehn twist about one of the generating curves) acts as this matrix on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ (it's in the general linear group $\mathbf{GL}(\mathbb{Z},2)$ of invertible
integer matrices), which does not preserve the decomposition as a product because it is
not diagonal. However, if one is given the torus as a product
$(T,t_0) = (s^1, x_0) \times (S^1, y_0)$ - equivalently, given a decomposition of the space - then
the splitting of the group follows from the general statement earlier. In categorical terms,
the relevant category (preserving the structure of a product space) is "maps of product
spaces, namely a pair of maps between the respective components".

Naturality is a categorical notion, and requires being very precise about exactly what data
is given – the torus as a space that happens to be a product (in the category of spaces
and continuous maps) is different from the torus presented as a product (in the category
of products of two spaces and continuous maps between the respective components).


\textbf{Example: dual of a finite-dimensional vector space}


Every finite-dimensional vector space is isomorphic to its dual space, but there may be
many different isomorphisms between the two spaces. There is in general no natural
isomorphism between a finite-dimensional vector space and its dual space.[1] However,
related categories (with additional structure and restrictions on the maps) do have a
natural isomorphism, as described below.

The dual space of a finite-dimensional vector space is again a finite-dimensional vector
space of the same dimension, and these are thus isomorphic, since dimension is the only
invariant of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a given field. However, in the absence
of additional constraints (such as a requirement that maps preserve the chosen basis), the
map from a space to its dual is not unique, and thus such an isomorphism requires a
choice, and is "not natural". On the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces and
linear maps, one can define an infranatural isomorphism from vector spaces to their dual
by choosing an isomorphism for each space (say, by choosing a basis for every vector
space and taking the corresponding isomorphism), but this will not define a natural
transformation. Intuitively this is because it required a choice, rigorously because any
such choice of isomorphisms will not commute with, say, the zero map; see (Mac Lane &
Birkhoff 1999, §VI.4) for detailed discussion.



Starting from finite-dimensional vector spaces (as objects) and the identity and dual
functors, one can define a natural isomorphism, but this requires first adding additional
structure, then restricting the maps from "all linear maps" to "linear maps that respect
this structure". Explicitly, for each vector space, require that it comes with the data of an
isomorphism to its dual, $\eta_V : V \to V^*$. In other words, take as objects vector spaces with
a nondegenerate bilinear form $b_v : V \times V \to K$. This defines an infranatural
isomorphism (isomorphism for each object). One then restricts the maps to only those
maps $T : V \to U$ that commute with the isomorphisms: $T^* (\eta_U(T(v))) = \eta_V (v)$ or in
other words, preserve the bilinear form: $b_v(T(v),T(w)) = b_V(v,w)$.  (These maps
define the naturalizer of the isomorphisms.) The resulting category, with objects finite-
dimensional vector spaces with a nondegenerate bilinear form, and maps linear
transforms that respect the bilinear form, by construction has a natural isomorphism from
the identity to the dual (each space has an isomorphism to its dual, and the maps in the
category are required to commute). Viewed in this light, this construction (add transforms
for each object, restrict maps to commute with these) is completely general, and does not
depend on any particular properties of vector spaces.

In this category (finite-dimensional vector spaces with a nondegenerate bilinear form,
maps linear transforms that respect the bilinear form), the dual of a map between vector
spaces can be identified as a transpose. Often for reasons of geometric interest this is
specialized to a subcategory, by requiring that the nondegenerate bilinear forms have
additional properties, such as being symmetric (orthogonal matrices), symmetric and
positive definite (inner product space), symmetric sesquilinear (Hermitian spaces), skew-
symmetric and totally isotropic (symplectic vector space), etc. – in all these categories a
vector space is naturally identified with its dual, by the nondegenerate bilinear form.
