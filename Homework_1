\section{Problem 1} (Calculus 1) Let $v_1$ be the velocity of light in air and $v_2$ be the velocity of
light in water. A ray of light will travel from a point $A$ in air to a point $B$ in water by a
path $ACB$ that minimizes the time taken. Show that


$sin \theta_1 /sin \theta_2 = v_1 / v_2$

where $\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence and $\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction. This equation is known
as Snell's law.


\section{Problem 2} (Calculus 2) A 200 lb cable is 100 ft long and hangs from a tall build-
ing. How much work is required to lift the cable to the top of the building. Recall that

$work = force \times distance$


\section{Problem 3} (Calculus 3) A rectangular box without a lid is to be made from $12 m^2$ of
cardboard. Find the maximum volume of such a box.


\section{Problem 4} (Math 314) Use the $\delta$- definition of continuity to show that the following
functions are continuous:
(a) $f(x) = x^2$
(b) $g(x) = \sqrt{x}$



\section{Problem 5} Read the entire Section $6^*$ The Skeleton of Calculus in your book. The first
sentence reads: “The behavior of a continuous function defined on an interval [a, b] is at
the root of all calculus theory”. Looking back at your calculus and analysis experience so
far, what do you think?
